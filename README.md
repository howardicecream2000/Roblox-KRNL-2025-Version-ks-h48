## üìñ About This Utility

KRNL is a lightweight and advanced scripting platform designed specifically for the Windows version of Roblox. It allows users to run external Lua-based scripts inside Roblox experiences, enabling a range of advanced capabilities for development, automation, and prototyping. Unlike traditional injectors, KRNL is optimized for performance and security, with built-in support for script hubs, custom UI frameworks, and rapid execution without disrupting the game‚Äôs core engine.

This tool is commonly used by developers and power users who wish to explore how scripting can interact with Roblox's game logic, UI layers, and gameplay systems. It supports a wide variety of modern Roblox APIs and runs smoothly alongside the latest versions of the Roblox client. KRNL includes a safe injection mechanism that works in parallel with the game without making permanent system-level changes, which makes it suitable for testing isolated script environments.

The utility is also fully portable, meaning no installation is necessary. You can download, extract, and start using it within minutes. Regular updates ensure compatibility with platform changes, and the built-in auto-updater streamlines the entire maintenance process. Whether you're a beginner learning Lua scripting or an experienced user building your own script sets, KRNL offers the performance and reliability you need.

This build includes all standard features like:

- Lua executor with high compatibility for modern Roblox APIs
